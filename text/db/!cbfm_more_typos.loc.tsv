missions_localised_description_wh3_main_ie_qb_lzd_mazdamundi_cobra_mace_of_mazdamundi	Lord Mazdamundi, greatest of Mage-Priests, senses that the Great Plan is failing. The certain cause is the vile proliferation of warmbloods within his realm. There must come a purge! Yet in this he is thwarted, for since his awakening he is without his fabled Cobra Mace. The semi-sentient weapon of legend was long ago left to regain its fading power from the sacred rocks of the Isle of the Crimson Skull. For the purge to proceed, it must be reclaimed forthwith. Yet darker news awaits. Accursed Skaven swarm across the hallowed isle, covetous of its sorcerous stones. This outrage must be repaid â€“ and only absolute extinction will suffice.	false

incidents_localised_description_wh2_dlc14_incident_brt_repanse_vampiric_scorchers	Every morning brought more disappearances. The Vampires' stolen victims would never be found, their drained bodies lost in a heartbeat to the pitiless winds and scouring sands of the endless desert. No more. No more! In the name of the Lady, in the name of truth and purity, Bretonnia's Knights have tracked the vile blood-drinkers to their nest, thus rendering her people safe from undying evil... for now.	false
